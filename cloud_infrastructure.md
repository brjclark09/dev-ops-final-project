# Cloud Infrastructure
## EC2
Launching an instance on EC2 takes:
- An operating system (RedHat Linux)
    - The operating system is what the computer will be running.
- An instance type (t2.micro)
    - The instance type is the hardware that AWS will be using.
- A security key pair
    - The security key pair file will allow access through the PuTTY terminal.
- A security group
    - The security group will allow computers to communicate on certain ports.
